### Funded opportunities  

## MSc position available in coastal ecology  

*Summary*: Oyster farmers lack an easy and rapid tool to determine oyster performance during their grow-out; a real-time monitoring system to track valve opening behavior (VOB) could fill this gap. VOB reflects oystersâ€™ response to environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, hypoxia, toxic algae) and can indicate stressful, or lethal conditions. Funding is available for a Master student to conduct a project aiming at quantifying the effect of environmental conditions and growing techniques on VOB, including: 1) experimentally measure the sensitivity of oyster VOB to changes in environmental conditions; 2) monitor VOB of oysters during grow-out.

*Desired candidate profiles*: Applicants must fulfill the admission requirements of the School of Renewable Natural Resources (see details here). Moreover, they must hold a valid driving license, or be prepared to obtain one upon joining. Additional essential attributes include being diligent, committed, self-motivated, enthusiastic, and dependable. Individuals from any social, ethnic, racial, cultural, and national backgrounds are welcome and encouraged to apply.

Interested applicants must have a background in biology or a related discipline (e.g., physiology or ecology). Previous experience and interest in conducting both field and experimental work is appreciated. Good data management and writing skills are expected. Data analysis and manipulation in Rare desirable, but not essential as training can be provided.

*Support*: This position comes with a graduate research assistantship ($24,000/year) & tuition covered.

*Dates*: January 2023-December 2025.

*Laboratory and Institutional Environment*: The successful candidate will join a young and aspiring group within a dynamic, collaborative, inclusive, and established department. The lab is housed in the School of Renewable Natural Resources on the vibrant LSU Baton Rouge campus.

*Contact*: Interested candidates should reach-out to Romain Lavaud (rlavaud@agcenter.lsu.edu) with the email subject: MSc in Coastal Ecology. Formal applications must include: (i) Statement of Purpose, (ii) curriculum vitae (CV), (iii) academic transcripts, and (iv) contact details of three referees.
