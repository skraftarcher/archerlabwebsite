**Funded Graduate Research Assistantship for a Masters student at University of New Orleans and Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium**  

**Start:** Fall 2022 or Winter 2023  

**Description:**  

We are seeking a student for a funded position to study the link between soundscapes and fish diversity and habitat use on artificial reefs in Louisiana.The Louisiana Artificial Reef Program was established with the goals of facilitating access by Louisiana fishers, both recreational and commercial, and enhancing and conserving fisheries resources. In order to fulfill these goals fished species must both utilize the reefs and reefs must result in new biomass production rather than simply attracting and concentrating existing fishes. Reefs may contribute to new biomass production if fishes use them as refuges from predation, feeding grounds, or spawning habitat. Therefore, the first step in determining if artificial reefs are contributing to both the conservation and fisheries related goals of the Louisiana Artificial Reef program, we must first gain a better understanding of which fishes are utilizing the reefs, when, and for what purpose. The selected student will develop methods to explore using passive acoustic monitoring to answer the questions of which, when, and why fishes use artificial reefs. 

**Support:**  

The position is funded for three years through Louisiana Sea Grant and Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries’ Artificial Reef Research Assistantship Program. The student will join University of New Orleans (UNO) [Biological Sciences Program](https://www.uno.edu/academics/cos/biology) and be co-advised by Dr. Stephanie Archer at [Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium](https://lumcon.edu) and [Dr. Kelly Boyle](https://www.fishmorphandbehavior.org/kelly-s-boyle.html) at UNO.  As part of this funding the student will complete a 100 hr internship with LDWF’s Artificial Reef Program. 

**Required Qualifications**  
+ A Bachelor’s degree in ecology, biology, or related field. Degrees in other fields with comparable experiences and a multidisciplinary mindset will be considered.  
+ Desire to build and maintain strong multi-institutional collaborations  
+ Ability to maintain a professional and positive attitude while working independently and collaboratively with a culturally diverse team
