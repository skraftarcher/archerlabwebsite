### **Stephanie K. Archer, PI**     

{{<imagewithtext img="/images/IMG_0103.jpg" width="330" text="Dr. Archer completed her PhD at North Carolina State University where she worked in the Layman Lab studying how sponges alter community composition and ecosystem function in tropical and subtropical nearshore marine ecosystems. She then moved on to work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada in multiple capacities. There she studied species interactions and ecosystem function of Glass Sponge Reefs and worked to develop efficient monitoring methods grounded in a strong understanding of the behavior and ecology of keystone species. She is now an Assistant Professor at LUMCON establishing a local research program focused on coastal Louisiana's sponges, oyster reefs, and other biogenic habitats. Outside of work she has a healthy obsession with University of Georgia football (go Dawgs!), loves to cook and read, and enjoys gardening, kayaking, and generally being outside.">}}

### **Finella Campanino, Graduate Student**  
{{<imagewithtextright img="/images/fia crab proj.jpg" width="330" text="Finella completed her undergraduate at the State University of New York College at Oneonta where she worked on several projects. She did field work on Andros Island, The Bahamas to collect a comprehensive population survey for the Bahamas National Trust to help develop a management plan for the National Park dedicated to conserving the giant land crab (Crab Replenishment Reserve). In addition to field work, she tested the effects of curcumin on respiration in yeast cells in my undergraduate’s biochemistry laboratory and performed a computational clustering analysis to view age cohorts of the larval form of a North American insect species within a stream. She moved to Louisiana and is was a Research Technician at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab, primarily working on oyster reef community ecology and Louisiana sponges. Finella is now co-advised by Drs. Archer and Megan La Peyre at LSU; she is getting her Masters working on biodiversity associated with oyster reefs. Outside of science, she loves to play volleyball, read, watch movies, and play board games with her friends!">}}

### **Allison Noble, Graduate Student**  
Bio coming soon.

### **Siyah Yongue, Graduate Student**  
{{<imagewithtext img="/images/SYongue.jpg" width="330"text="Siyah completed her undergraduate degree in Marine Sciences at the University of Florida. Throughout her time there she studied abroad in Belize, helped survey for the Santa Fe River Turtle project, and participated in the Undergraduate Coral Research Initiative funded by NSF. She was also a research assistant for the Benthic Ecology lab at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Wetland and Aquatic Research Center. At USGS, she worked on a variety of projects regarding mangrove preservation, coral restoration, deep-sea trophic ecology, microchemistry connectivity for Red and Vermilion Snapper, and infaunal community analysis post-Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill. She was able to board NOAA’s Nancy Foster and the University of Southern Mississippi’s Point Sur research vessels, where she helped with processing sediment cores, collecting and processing CTD samples for eDNA and particulate organic matter studies, and imaging/quantifying the deep-sea community in the Gulf of Mexico. Siyah is now co-advised by Drs. Archer and Lavaud at LSU, where she is getting her Masters focusing on tracking the eastern oyster’s behavioral responses under predicted climate change conditions (i.e., low salinity and dissolved oxygen) in both laboratory and natural settings. Outside of science, she loves exploring new places, hiking, reading, trying new foods, setting up/maintaining aquariums, and spending time with family and friends!">}}

### **Ariel Alonso, Graduate Student**  

{{<imagewithtext img="/images/ariel1.jpg" width="330"text="Ariel completed her undergraduate degree in Biological Science at University of New Orleans where she was a research assistant in Dr. Kelly Boyle’s lab. There she worked on effects of fish calling behavior caused from boat noise using recordings from Dauphin Island, Alabama. She also worked in Dr. Erin Cox’s lab and she did field work in Florida collecting seagrass. She recently finished a non-thesis masters programat Tulane University in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department with Dr. Hank Bart Jr. as her advisor. They worked on 3D fish modeling from underwater videos using deep learning methods. Ariel was also a Graduate Intern at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab working on comparing fish calling behavior between sponge reefs and rocky reefs in the Salish Sea in Canada. Ariel is now a graduate student at University of New Orleans working with Dr. Kelly Boyle and as an honorary member of the Archer Lab. Aside from school and science, she is involved in many volunteer positions through Ducks Unlimited. she is a chapter volunteer, Area Greenwing Chairman for our chapter and the chairman for the Greenwing Youth Organization in the state of Louisiana. She also loves to drink coffee, play with my animals, watch movies, hunt and fish and anything to do with the outdoors!">}}

### **Kay Schlachter, Research Associate**
Bio coming soon.

### **Grace Hancock, Collections Assistant**  

{{<imagewithtext img="/images/grace.jpg" width="330" text="Grace Hancock is currently the collections assistant for LUMCON’s Coastal Marine Biodiversity Collection. She is originally from Portland OR but received her bachelor's degree in Biology and Spanish from Kalamazoo College in June 2022 where she worked with Dr. Santiago Salinas in the Kalamazoo College Fish Lab. There, they studied the effects of temperature fluctuations on a species of estuarine fish that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. She also spent a period of time interning at the GEMM lab at the Hatfield Marine Science Center studying Blue whale migration. Both of these experiences encouraged her to pursue a career in marine biology and ignited her curiosity of marine fauna. When she is hanging out in the collections room, she enjoys anything that gets her outside, reading, sewing, and playing music with her family!">}}

### **Tam Ta, Undergraduate Researcher**  

{{<imagewithtextright img="/images/PXL_20210815_180937220_2.jpg" width="330" text="Tam is currently an undergrad at the University of Washington majoring in Environmental Science and Medical Laboratory Science. She started at LUMCON as an REU Intern where she examined fish calling behaviors in glass sponge reef ecosystems. Going forward, she will be working on a passive acoustic research project looking at fish calling behaviors and biodiversity in glass sponge reefs. Tam is also working as a Student Assistant in the Quantitative Conservation Lab at the University of Washington. She is currently working through data entry and camera trap processing for seabird monitoring in the Channel Islands National Park. When she is not working, you can find her hiking, embroidering, and drinking bubble tea.">}}
