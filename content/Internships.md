<font size=6>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program </font>  

Each summer [LUMCON](https://lumcon.edu/) hosts a cohort of undergraduate students as [REU students](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/). These students join a lab, conduct hands-on research, and participate in professional development workshops (i.e., how to apply to graduate school). Although application deadlines vary slightly from year to year, the deadline is typically in March. If you are an undergraduate interested in joining my lab for a summer REU experience please read more about the program here: [LUMCON's REU Program](https://lumcon.edu/reu/)
