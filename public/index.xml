      <description>Welcome to the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab at Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium LUMCON . We are a group of ecologists who spend our time exploring the fundamental principles that underpin the structure and function of biogenic habitats, or habitats formed by plants or animals. We use a combination of observational and experimental approaches to elucidate the role that habitat forming species play in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in the Anthropocene.</description>

      <description>Undergraduate opportunities  Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program 
Each summer LUMCON hosts a cohort of undergraduate students as REU students. These students join a lab, conduct hands-on research, and participate in professional development workshops (i.e., how to apply to graduate school). Although application deadlines vary slightly from year to year, the deadline is typically in March. If you are an undergraduate interested in joining my lab for a summer REU experience please read more about the program here: LUMCON&amp;rsquo;s REU Program</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
The Benthic Ecology Lab (archerbenthicecologylab.com) at Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) is seeking to hire one Research Technician beginning as early as September 2023. The successful applicant will assist Dr. Archer on multiple projects focused on invasive species (Invasive carp) and the ecology of biogenic habitats (e.g., oyster reefs, seagrass beds, and sponge grounds). The successful applicant will join a growing lab that uses a wide variety of approaches (e.</description>

      <description>Ecology, and science in general, has largely been the purview of a privileged subset of individuals. Ecology has suffered because of this. In this lab we will work to create opportunities for those who have traditionally been excluded from our field. We will do this in many ways, including but not limited to, prioritizing requests for funds to provide paid internships and research experiences for underrepresented groups and working with traditional knowledge holders to create or solidify pathways for their ways of knowing to be recognized and incorporated into ecological theory and ecosystem management.</description>

      <description>Stephanie K. Archer, PI Dr. Archer completed her PhD at North Carolina State University where she worked in the Layman Lab studying how sponges alter community composition and ecosystem function in tropical and subtropical nearshore marine ecosystems. She then moved on to work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada in multiple capacities. There she studied species interactions and ecosystem function of Glass Sponge Reefs and worked to develop efficient monitoring methods grounded in a strong understanding of the behavior and ecology of keystone species.</description>

      <description>Study systems Biogenic habitats, or habitats formed by living organisms, such as coral reefs, sponge grounds, and seagrass beds are among the most biodiverse ecosystems in the oceans. They provide us with many ecosystem services from food production and natural products chemistry to shoreline protection and storm buffering. They are also among the most impacted systems, suffering from a wide range of anthropogenic and natural stressors that combine to threaten their continued existence.</description>
