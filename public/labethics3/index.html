    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Ecology, and science in general, has largely been the purview of a privileged subset of individuals. Ecology has suffered because of this. In this lab we will work to create opportunities for those who have traditionally been excluded from our field. We will do this in many ways, including but not limited to, prioritizing requests for funds to provide paid internships and research experiences for underrepresented groups and working with traditional knowledge holders to create or solidify pathways for their ways of knowing to be recognized and incorporated into ecological theory and ecosystem management. In order to create a space where these initiatives can thrive we adhere to the following principles:</p>
<p>People come first, mental health is prerequisite for good science.</p>
<p>Communication is always a two-way street.</p>
<p>There is much more to life than the scientific endeavor.</p>
<p>We will always operate from a place of kindness and support.</p>
<p>Flexibility - we don&rsquo;t all think, work, or process information in the same way. If you know what works for you, do it.</p>
<p>We will always celebrate each other. Wins, no matter how small, deserve to be recognized.</p>
<p>Bullying, gaslighting, and exclusion have no place here and should be called out whenever they occur.</p>
<p>We are all human, we will mess up, but we will also try to be humble and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>We will advocate for each other and be each others' fiercest defenders.</p>
