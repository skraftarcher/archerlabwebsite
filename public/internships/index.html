<p><font size=6>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program </font></p>
<p>Each summer <a href="https://lumcon.edu/">LUMCON</a> hosts a cohort of undergraduate students as <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/">REU students</a>. These students join a lab, conduct hands-on research, and participate in professional development workshops (i.e., how to apply to graduate school). Although application deadlines vary slightly from year to year, the deadline is typically in March. If you are an undergraduate interested in joining my lab for a summer REU experience please read more about the program here: <a href="https://lumcon.edu/reu/">LUMCON&rsquo;s REU Program</a></p>

<center><font size=20><b> Graduate opportunities <b></font></center> 
<p>We are beyond thrilled to announce that LUMCON has established a new fellowship to support a graduate student from an underrepresented group in STEM. The selected fellow will spend 10 weeks in residence at LUMCON while they will complete a research project that will contribute to their thesis/dissertation. During their stay at LUMCON the fellow will receive a $7,500 stipend, be provided with office space, and up to 5 days of small boat use. Additionally, the fellow will be sponsored by a LUMCON faculty member who will provide logistic support, local knowledge, laboratory space, and mentorship/collaboration. For more information on the program and how to apply visit <a href="https://lumcon.edu/graduate-fellowship-program/">https://lumcon.edu/graduate-fellowship-program/</a></p>
<p>If you are interested in this program and would like to talk about being sponsored by Dr. Archer, please email her at sarcher at lumcon.edu with your thesis/dissertation topic, your idea(s) for research during the fellowship period, and any questions you may have about the program.</p>
