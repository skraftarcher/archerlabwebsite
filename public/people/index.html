<h3 id="stephanie-k-archer-pi"><strong>Stephanie K. Archer, PI</strong></h3>
<p>Dr. Archer completed her PhD at North Carolina State University where she worked in the Layman Lab studying how sponges alter community composition and ecosystem function in tropical and subtropical nearshore marine ecosystems. She then moved on to work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada in multiple capacities. There she studied species interactions and ecosystem function of Glass Sponge Reefs and worked to develop efficient monitoring methods grounded in a strong understanding of the behavior and ecology of keystone species. She is now an Assistant Professor at LUMCON establishing a local research program focused on coastal Louisiana&rsquo;s sponges, oyster reefs, and other biogenic habitats. Outside of work she has a healthy obsession with University of Georgia football (go Dawgs!), loves to cook and read, and enjoys gardening, kayaking, and generally being outside.</p>

<h3 id="finella-campanino-research-assistant"><strong>Finella Campanino, Research Assistant</strong></h3>
<p>Finella completed her undergraduate at the State University of New York College at Oneonta where she worked on several projects. She did field work on Andros Island, The Bahamas to collect a comprehensive population survey for the Bahamas National Trust to help develop a management plan for the National Park dedicated to conserving the giant land crab (Crab Replenishment Reserve). In addition to field work, she tested the effects of curcumin on respiration in yeast cells in my undergraduateâ€™s biochemistry laboratory and performed a computational clustering analysis to view age cohorts of the larval form of a North American insect species within a stream. She moved to Louisiana and is now a Research Technician at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab, primarily working on oyster reef community ecology and Louisiana sponges. In January 2022 she will be going to LSU to get her Masters working on oyster reefs. Outside of science, she loves to play volleyball, read, watch movies, and play board games with her friends!</p>
