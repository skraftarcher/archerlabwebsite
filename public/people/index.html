    <div id="sectionright">Dr. Archer completed her PhD at North Carolina State University where she worked in the Layman Lab studying how sponges alter community composition and ecosystem function in tropical and subtropical nearshore marine ecosystems. She then moved on to work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada in multiple capacities. There she studied species interactions and ecosystem function of Glass Sponge Reefs and worked to develop efficient monitoring methods grounded in a strong understanding of the behavior and ecology of keystone species. She is now an Assistant Professor at LUMCON establishing a local research program focused on coastal Louisiana&#39;s sponges, oyster reefs, and other biogenic habitats. Outside of work she has a healthy obsession with University of Georgia football (go Dawgs!), loves to cook and read, and enjoys gardening, kayaking, and generally being outside.</div>

    <div id="sectionleft2">Finella completed her undergraduate at the State University of New York College at Oneonta where she worked on several projects. She did field work on Andros Island, The Bahamas to collect a comprehensive population survey for the Bahamas National Trust to help develop a management plan for the National Park dedicated to conserving the giant land crab (Crab Replenishment Reserve). In addition to field work, she tested the effects of curcumin on respiration in yeast cells in my undergraduate’s biochemistry laboratory and performed a computational clustering analysis to view age cohorts of the larval form of a North American insect species within a stream. She moved to Louisiana and is now a Research Technician at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab, primarily working on oyster reef community ecology and Louisiana sponges. In January 2022 she will be going to LSU to get her Masters working on oyster reefs. Outside of science, she loves to play volleyball, read, watch movies, and play board games with her friends!</div>

<section>
    <div id="sectionleft"><img src='/images/ariel1.jpg' width='330'></div>
    <div id="sectionright">Ariel completed her undergraduate degree in Biological Science at University of New Orleans where she was a research assistant in Dr. Kelly Boyle’s lab. There she worked on effects of fish calling behavior caused from boat noise using recordings from Dauphin Island, Alabama. She also worked in Dr. Erin Cox’s lab and she did field work in Florida collecting seagrass. She is currently at Tulane University in the non-thesis masters program in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department with Dr. Hank Bart Jr. as her advisor. They have worked on 3D fish modeling from underwater videos using deep learning methods. Ariel is currently a Graduate Intern at LUMCON in the Archer Benthic Ecology Lab working on comparing fish calling behavior between sponge reefs and rocky reefs in the Salish Sea in Canada. Aside from school and science, she is involved in many volunteer positions through Ducks Unlimited. she is a chapter volunteer, Area Greenwing Chairman for our chapter and the chairman for the Greenwing Youth Organization in the state of Louisiana. She also loves to drink coffee, play with my animals, watch movies, hunt and fish and anything to do with the outdoors!</div>

    <div id="sectionright">Tam is currently an undergrad at the University of Washington majoring in Environmental Science and Medical Laboratory Science. She started at LUMCON as an REU Intern where she examined fish calling behaviors in glass sponge reef ecosystems. Going forward, she will be working on a passive acoustic research project looking at fish calling behaviors and biodiversity in glass sponge reefs. Tam is also working as a Student Assistant in the Quantitative Conservation Lab at the University of Washington. She is currently working through data entry and camera trap processing for seabird monitoring in the Channel Islands National Park. When she is not working, you can find her hiking, embroidering, and drinking bubble tea.</div>
